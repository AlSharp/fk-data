***European Parliament President***

***Roberta Metsola***

Dear Madam President!

We take this opportunity to assure you of our highest consideration.

The Free Nations League, uniting Tatars, Bashkirs, Buryats, Yakuts, Kalmyks, Chechens, Erzyans, Mokshans, Cossacks and Ingrians in their fight for the right to self-determination, is addressing you.

Today we are deprived thereof, because our republics and regions  were transformed  into colonies of centralized empire. Our peoples are not allowed to study in their native language. Our national organizations and parties are banned and dissolved. Our politicians are imprisoned, killed, maimed or forced to emigrate. Moscow is plundering the republics, rapaciously exploiting their rich subsoil, leaving ruins and ecological disaster zones. Our peoples became subjects to covert genocide, since Moscow is mobilizing a disproportionate number of representatives of the autochthonous population to continue the barbaric war in Ukraine.

However, even in these conditions, our peoples demonstrate their subjectness not only by means of political statements, but also by means of  direct actions, preventing mobilization for another aggressive colonial war waged by Russia upon  Ukraine.

Despite the fact that ethnic non-Russians make up a significant part of the population of the Russian Federation, and the national republics occupy the vast territory of a pseudo-federation, our voice is ignored and systematically muffled.

Moreover, we notice  that the Russian opposition politicians in exile speak publicly on behalf of all the territories and all the peoples of the Russian Federation, for which they do not have a legitimate  mandate.

With this in mind, we, the members of the Free Nations League, declare:

1. Any negotiations regarding the territories that are now under the rule of Moscow must take place with our participation – Tatars, Bashkirs, Buryats, Yakuts, Kalmyks, Chechens, Erzyans, Mokshans, Cossacks, as well as representatives of other peoples and regionalist movements.

2. Russian opposition politicians in exile can represent themselves, but none of the national movements, not a single national representative body has given them a mandate to represent our interests.

3. A dialogue “about Russia” with representatives of the Moscow elites or counter-elites, behind the back of the peoples of the North Caucasus, Idel-Ural, Siberia, as well as other Moscow colonies, will irreversibly lead to a tension and radicalization of the situation. Non-Russian ethnicities   will receive a clear signal from European politicians: ***‘They talk to Muscovites about our lands and our wealth, they talk behind our back’***.

We ask you not to oppose our peoples to ethnic Russians, moving us away from contacts with the European Parliament, and replacing dialogue with the peoples of the Russian Federation with a dialogue with several Moscow politicians. The Free Nations League does not recognize any "transitional governments" or other self-proclaimed structures of the Russian opposition.

We are counting on your balanced and wise position.

Sincerely,
