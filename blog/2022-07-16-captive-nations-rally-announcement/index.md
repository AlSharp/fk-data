Activists of the national movement of nations held captive by the Russian Federation will rally in different countries in order to bring the anti-imperial activists all around the world together.

On July 23, the Free Nations League, which brings together representatives of the nations held captive by the Kremlin, will hold peaceful street actions.

No war! Down with the empire! Freedom to the captive nations! Under these slogans, we take to the streets of cities around the world.

We ask the governments of democratic countries to support the right of the non-Russian nations in the Russian Federation to self-determination. The right to restore independence and their own states! The right that was taken from us forcefully!
