***Chair of the Munich Security Conference***

***Christoph Heusgen***

Dear Mr. Heusgen!

We take this opportunity to assure you of our highest consideration.

The Free Nations League, uniting Tatars, Bashkirs, Buryats, Yakuts, Kalmyks, Chechens, Erzyans, Mokshans, Cossacks and Ingrians in their fight for the right to self-determination, is addressing you.

Today we are deprived thereof, because our republics and regions  were transformed  into colonies of centralized empire. Our peoples are not allowed to study in their native language. Our national organizations and parties are banned and dissolved. Our politicians are imprisoned, killed, maimed or forced to emigrate. Moscow is plundering the republics, rapaciously exploiting their rich subsoil, leaving ruins and ecological disaster zones. Our peoples became subjects to covert genocide, since Moscow is mobilizing a disproportionate number of representatives of the autochthonous population to continue the barbaric war in Ukraine.

However, even in these conditions, our peoples demonstrate their subjectness not only by means of political statements, but also by means of  direct actions, preventing mobilization for another aggressive colonial war waged by Russia upon  Ukraine.

Despite the fact that ethnic non-Russians make up a significant part of the population of the Russian Federation, and the national republics occupy the vast territory of a pseudo-federation, our voice is ignored and systematically muffled.

From your Twitter account, we learned that representatives of Russian opposition groups in exile are planning to attend the upcoming MSC2022 meeting. We applaud the Conference's decision not to invite officials from the Kremlin and to give voice to those who publicly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine and do not support this unjust colonial war.

In this regard, we ask you to give the opportunity to speak at the forum to the representatives of the Free Nations League. We sincerely hope that the conversation about the future of the Russian territories provides an opportunity to hear our opinion – the opinion of millions of representatives of indigenous peoples and residents of the regions. We would like to believe that  MSC2022 understands there is a place not only for dialogue with Russians, but also for dialogue with Tatars, Bashkirs, Buryats, Yakuts, Kalmyks, Chechens, Erzyans, Mokshans, Cossacks, Ingrians and other peoples.

We ask you not to oppose our peoples to ethnic Russians, moving us away from contacts with the European Parliament, and replacing dialogue with the peoples in the Russian Federation with a dialogue with several Moscow politicians. The Free Nations League does not recognize any so-called "transitional governments" or other self-proclaimed structures of the Russian opposition.

We are counting on your balanced and wise position.

Sincerely,
